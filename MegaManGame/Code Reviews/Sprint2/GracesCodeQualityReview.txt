Comment Use: Good
-Jack uses comments in methods that he must include due to the interface but has no code for in this particular state
However this calls to question how necessary these methods are to include in the interface if they are all being left blank
I believe there were three in total that fit this description.

Method Use: Decent
-Methods are used to prevent illegal state changes, such use running immediately after jumping.
-GetDirection is used as a getter for the private variable reverse. Should it be possible maybe rename the variable 
reverse to something more descriptive and appropriate and have it match GetDirection.
-It is a bit confusing what the boolean variable being passed into Jumping in the Update method is doing, maybe a quick
descriptor of its purpose would be clarifying.

Coupling and Cohesion: Good
-This class has high cohesion. It has specific task, store what possible next states a player can enter from the 
current state they are in. It also offers a method to get information about the current state, which is still 
tightly related to it's other purposes.
-As for coupling, this class references a sprite class and a couple other state classes. When compared to how many
classes there are however, it has deceidedly low coupling. It is only aware of a player, not the full game itself.
