Comments: 
-Variables are easy to read and rather self explanatory.

-The logic within the class is clean and organized. Overall, it's really easy to read and follow.

-"ToSlowDownFPS" isn't as clear as other variable names

Hypothetical change: 
Maybe have some comments explaining what the delay variables do as these are the only things that aren't as self explanatory.
