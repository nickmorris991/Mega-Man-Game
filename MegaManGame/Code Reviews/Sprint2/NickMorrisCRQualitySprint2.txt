File Under Review: BluePogoEnemy.cs

Time Taken: 15 minutes

Naming: Could be better 
	- the naming like "mySprite" really doesn't make sense on it's own. Of course an ISprite object is a sprite, try and 
	be more descriptive here like "enemySprite" or even a specific enemy sprite

	- Same with location - this could be enemyLocation or bluePogo Location, location by itself doesnt really tell us anything
	what is it the location of? 

	- try to be slightly more consistent with camelCase vs PascalCase overall that seems to be fairly good though

Design: Reasonable
	- some of the things may be able to be abstracted further into an abstract class for the actual enemys. Draw and Update 
	seem fairly repetitive.

	- white space is somewhat inconsistent. You have whitespace between each individual method but not the start of the method or 
	betweeen the class and the method. The most important thing here is to just be consistent. 

	- As far the namespace of the file is concerned, id consider making it more general like MegaMan instead of the specific 
	folder name, this allows that enemy to be used in other folders without the folder extension and I don't think 
	there are any ambiguity problems with this. 

	- fairly certian the this keyword isn't completely necessary here. 

	- cohesion seems to be fairly high. Only two methods and each is doing a very well defined task. 

	- coupling is also low, good job here. 

Suggested Changes: 

	- there is some duplicate code that may be able to change in some abstract classes for the actual client side enemy sprites
	I realize the enemy sprites themselves are abstracted away with an abstract class so this may not be needed. 
	
	- I would be more specific with your variable names "location, mysprite, etc" aren't great. 

	- Consider removing all whitespace.
