During sprint2 we had several things to improve upon. First, one of the aspects we did well was researching the needed sprites for Mega Man
gutsman stage. Several were difficult to find. On the other hand, we had multiple management aspects we can fix for the next sprite. We had
trouble assigning classes and tasks to people at an early stage of the sprint. We also had trouble committing the code with comments every 
time because not every team member knew that you could attach comments to commits. We also had trouble committing our changes on a regular 
basis that made it easier to avoid version control conflicts. In order to resolve these things in the future we will need to be more thorough 
with documentation, commit our changes more frequently, and start planning earlier. 

For example, one major issue we had was implementing the state machine to operate with the commands and sprites. We started implementing the 
states fairly late and this problem would likely be able to be addressed using graders and Boggus if we had started earlier.
