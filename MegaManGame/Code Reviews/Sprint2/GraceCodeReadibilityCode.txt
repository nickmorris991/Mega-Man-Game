Readibility Review

Naming: Good
-The name of the class tells the reader exactly what item they are dealing with along with its type
-Both variable names are descriptive however Location is in PascalCase while blockSprite is in camelCase. One 
should be chosen over the other so it is obvious to the reader that they are both just variables of the class
and there is no defining difference beyond type with them.

Explaining about what is being done: Decent
-There are no comments within the code, however with the descriptive variable and method names it's not entirely necessary

Addtional Notes:
-There appears to be excessive whitespace between variables and methods. Code could be condensed by eliminating that.
