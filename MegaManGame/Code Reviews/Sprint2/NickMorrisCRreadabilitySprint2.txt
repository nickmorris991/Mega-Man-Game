Comments: Overall, readability is good. Some of the critiques I have is some unclear variable names. "toSlowDownFPS" describes what the variable
is used for but not why it is what it is. Increasing cohesian here would also increase readability. Separating the if-statement branching
into meaningful method names would make that sequence more clear.
