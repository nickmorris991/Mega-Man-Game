Comments:

-Naming convention for the file and related files could be a bit better. Why not "GreenPlatformItemSprite"? Players, enemies and blocks could follow suit - but that is off topic. I think it's especially important for differentiating items vs. blocks

-Update is short and concise. It is very clean. All variables are clearly labelled with descriptive names.

-GameTime classes may be more effective in implementing the delay features as most animation use such features.

-"toSlowDownFPS" is descriptive but awkward. Maybe include a comment in the sprite classes describing what it does and why its value is what it is

-Similar to the above tip, "Delay" might need a comment explaining why the value is what it is. On top of this, the name of the variable is rather vague. An explanation of what it is might be nice as well.

-Otherwise, naming is pretty solid all around. I understand what the rest of the variables mean and can track their uses all the way down the file.

-Class variables should follow a consistent VariableName naming convention for c#, or should at least be consistent. I've changed this in the refactoring

-Overall, it has high cohesion with the ISprite and is very isolated so it has low coupling.
