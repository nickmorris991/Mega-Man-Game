- Naming Variables: Not terrible
		1. I'm not really sure why you have a texture2D in this class "sprite", which isn't a good name to begin with
		2. Same thing with the vector2 "position" try and be more descriptive than this. 
		3. Create collision is a good name
		4. Object1 and Object2 is also extrememly vague, this tells me nothing about what those objects are exactly.
		Try and do something like PlayerObject and CollisionObject or PlayerObject and ReferenceObject, so I know what 
		left and right is relative to. 
		5. I don't see what the public field "Rectangle is used for". Also this has the same problem of being very unspecific. 
		6. The is touching methods should assign names to that boolean logic so I know what each comparison means on a high level
		don't hard code these things in like that. 

- Fields: 
		1. I don't understand why "typeOfCollision" is public or "position"
		2. All of your fields can be private here you don't reference them in any other class that I can see. 
		3. Don't see why there is an "update" implementation for ICollisionDetector, this is taken care of in the collisionManager
- Overall:
		Style seems pretty eratic. Try and keep things like whitespace consistent. Don't really see you following the naming 
		convention defined in the README either. Just try and stay consistent here and this can improve quickly. 

All in all, implementation is good! But the readability for this file seems fairly low to me. A lot of room to improve!!
