During Sprint3 the team had massive improvements on planning compared to sprint2. We scheduled several team meetings 
outside of class that helped to prepare for everyone's respective duties. This was not done in sprint2. We took more 
responsibility over the burn down chart. Tried to pay more attention to tracking these goals so that everyone was made more 
aware of how each was doing on their tasks. I still think we could improve here, but it's definitely better planning compared 
to sprint2. Overall, the workflow was more or less steady. The biggest critique is waiting to do collision until towards the end 
of the sprint. We decided to do this because we wanted movement working so we could test collision. But honestly the logic could 
of been implemented first either way, this way we would of gotten the biggest head start on the hardest part of the sprint. It 
more or less worked out fine because we still finished all other tasks in time to accomplish collision but this could of been 
executed better for sure. Overall, the burn down chart was better utilized and team planning was more efficient. Hoping to keep 
this momentum going into refactoring and the next sprint.
