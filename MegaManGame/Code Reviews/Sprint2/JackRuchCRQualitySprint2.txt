Minutes to complete: 10 mins

Comments: 

- proper use of methods and return types

- clean implementation of PlayerSpriteFactory instance

- Consistent use variable capitalizaton and naming convention

-Loading of a dumby location for sprites works well now but we should change that in the future when we use specific locations

-variable name of reversed could be better, as in its curent state its hard to tell what it does

-Class has low cohesion but high coupling due to the fact that it almost exclusively manipulates other classes

-Unused private constructor could be used or removed

-we could probably load the sprite sheet in the game load sprites section

-Good consistent variable names
